# Product Requirements Document — Flex Workspace Booking

**Product codename:** `deskflow` (placeholder)
**Status:** Draft v0.2
**Owner:** TBD
**Last updated:** 2026-09-18 (stack decision revised — see §8)

---

## 1. Summary

A mobile-first workplace booking product for employers that run flex-seating ("hot desking") corporate
offices. Employees use an iOS/Android app to see who's coming in, reserve a desk or a conference room,
check in on arrival, and find their colleagues. Workplace admins use a web console to model their
offices, set booking policies, and understand how space is actually used.

The competitive reference point is deskbird; the wedge is a genuinely good mobile experience plus
a fast, low-ceremony admin setup, targeted at mid-market employers (200–5,000 employees) who find
enterprise IWMS suites too heavy.

---

## 2. Problem statement

Employers moved to hybrid work and reduced desk-to-employee ratios. This creates three unsolved problems:

1. **Employees** don't know whether there will be a seat, whether their team will be in, or where to sit.
   Uncertainty pushes them to stop coming in, which defeats the purpose of the office.
2. **Workplace / facilities teams** have no reliable data on real occupancy. They over- or under-lease,
   and they can't justify either decision. Spreadsheets and Outlook room calendars don't reflect reality.
3. **Managers** can't coordinate in-office days for their team, so "coming to the office" produces
   an empty floor and a video call anyway.

Existing tooling is either (a) heavyweight IWMS/CAFM platforms with long implementations, or
(b) calendar room-booking that ignores desks, check-in, and utilization entirely.

---

## 3. Goals and non-goals

### 3.1 Goals

| # | Goal | Measured by |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | Make booking a desk take under 15 seconds from cold app open | p75 time-to-booking (instrumented) |
| G2 | Give employees a reason to come in (social/team signal) | % of bookings preceded by viewing a colleague/team view |
| G3 | Produce trustworthy utilization data | Check-in rate ≥ 70% of bookings; no-show auto-release working |
| G4 | Let an admin stand up a new office in under 60 minutes | Time from org creation to first published floor |
| G5 | Support both desks and rooms in one model | Both bookable from a single flow by GA |

### 3.2 Non-goals (v1)

- Not a full IWMS: no lease management, maintenance work orders, CAD round-tripping, or space planning.
- Not an access-control system: we do not open doors or replace badge readers (we may read their data later).
- Not a visitor-management product in v1 (v2 candidate — see §9.5).
- No parking, locker, or catering booking in v1 (v2 candidates; the resource model must not preclude them).
- ~~No standalone web app for employees in v1 beyond a minimal responsive fallback.~~ *(Superseded
  2026-09-18 by §8.1: the client is one React codebase that runs natively and on the web, so the
  employee web app costs nothing to ship. Mobile remains the design priority and the product's
  centre of gravity — but web is no longer a cost to avoid.)*
- No on-premise / self-hosted deployment.

---

## 4. Personas

**P1 — Hybrid employee ("Priya", IC, in office 2–3 days/week).**
Books from her phone on the commute or the night before. Cares about: is my team in, is there a desk
near them, is it a sit/stand desk with a dock. Will abandon anything that takes more than a few taps.

**P2 — Team lead ("Marcus").**
Needs the team co-located on chosen days. Wants to set an anchor day, see who's booked, and book
on behalf of a report or a new joiner. Books rooms for team ceremonies.

**P3 — Workplace/Facilities manager ("Dana").**
Owns the floor plans, the policies, and the utilization report she presents to Finance quarterly.
Needs bulk operations, not per-desk clicking. Is not technical.

**P4 — IT admin ("Sam").**
Owns SSO, provisioning, and data-privacy sign-off. Will block the rollout if SCIM/SAML/OIDC and a
DPA aren't there. Rarely uses the product day to day.

**P5 — Receptionist / front-of-house (v2).**
Uses a kiosk/tablet to check walk-ins in and find a seat for a visitor.

## 5. Assumptions and open questions

### 5.1 Assumptions (stated, to be confirmed)

- **A1.** Multi-tenant B2B SaaS. One deployment, many customer organizations, row-level tenant isolation.
- **A2.** Purchased by the employer; employees are provisioned, not self-signup. Per-seat or per-active-user pricing.
- **A3.** Company-managed identity exists (Google Workspace or Microsoft Entra ID covers the large majority
  of the target market). Email magic-link is the fallback for the long tail.
- **A4.** Employees use personal or corporate phones with the public App Store / Play Store build.
  No MDM-only private distribution required at launch (see R4 in §12).
- **A5.** Floor plans exist as images or PDFs. We place desks on top of them; we do not parse CAD/IFC.
- **A6.** Initial markets: US and EU. EU means GDPR, works-council sensitivity around presence data,
  and i18n from the start (English, German, French, Spanish).

### 5.2 Open questions

| # | Question | Blocks | Default if unanswered |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Is the first customer a single design partner, or are we building for a market? | Prioritization of admin config depth | Build for a design partner, keep the model general |
| Q2 | Do we need Microsoft Intune / MAM app-protection wrapping? | Mobile stack (see §8.3) | No for v1 |
| Q3 | Do rooms need to be the source of truth, or mirror Exchange/Google Calendar? | Room architecture | Mirror the calendar; the calendar stays authoritative |
| Q4 | Is there an existing badge/access-control system whose swipe data we can ingest as check-in? | Check-in design | No; QR + geofence only |
| Q5 | Are assigned (permanently owned) desks in scope for v1? | Resource model | Yes — model it, ship the sharing behavior in Phase 3 |
| Q6 | Works-council / privacy posture on showing colleague presence | Colleague visibility features | Opt-out per user, org-level master switch |


### 5.3 Answer to Open Questions

Q1: Build for a design partner, keep the model general.
Q2: No for v1.
Q3: Rooms need to be the source of truth.
    **Revised 2026-09-11:** no Microsoft 365 / Google Calendar integration at all, in either
    direction. Room reservations happen only in the app. See TDD §7 — this removes the largest
    subsystem in the design; the one obligation that survives is making rooms unbookable in the
    corporate directory so they cannot also be booked from Outlook.
Q4: No; QR + geofence only.
Q5: Yes — model it, ship the sharing behavior in Phase 3.
Q6: Opt-out per user, org-level master switch.

---

## 6. Domain model (product-level, not schema)

```
Organization
 └── Site / Building              (address, timezone, opening hours, capacity cap)
      └── Floor                   (floor plan image, ordering)
           └── Zone / Neighborhood (a team's area; used for policies and search)
                ├── Desk          (bookable resource)
                └── Room          (bookable resource, has capacity + amenities)
```

- **Resource** is the generalization of Desk and Room, so parking spots, lockers and phone booths
  can be added later without a migration of the booking model.
- **Booking** is (resource, user, time range, status). Status: `pending` → `confirmed` → `checked_in`
  → `completed`, or `cancelled` / `released_no_show`.
- **Group** is a set of users (team, department, or arbitrary). Policies, zone permissions, and
  "who's in" views hang off groups.
- **Policy** attaches to an Organization, Site, or Group and constrains what bookings are legal.

## 7. Functional requirements

Requirements are labeled `FR-n.m`. Priority: **P0** = v1 must-ship, **P1** = v1 if time, **P2** = post-v1.

### 7.1 Identity, onboarding, access

| # | Requirement | Pri |
|---|---|---|
| FR-1.1 | SSO via OIDC with Google Workspace and Microsoft Entra ID, initiated from the mobile app | P0 |
| FR-1.2 | Email magic-link sign-in as fallback; domain-allowlist enforced per org | P0 |
| FR-1.3 | Domain-based org discovery: user enters work email, app resolves the tenant and routes to the right IdP | P0 |
| FR-1.4 | Session persists across app restarts; refresh-token rotation; remote session revoke by admin | P0 |
| FR-1.5 | Biometric re-auth (Face ID / fingerprint) to reopen the app, optional per org | P1 |
| FR-1.6 | SCIM 2.0 user/group provisioning and deprovisioning | P1 |
| FR-1.7 | SAML 2.0 for orgs whose IdP does not do OIDC well | P2 |
| FR-1.8 | Roles: Employee, Team Lead, Site Admin, Org Admin. Permissions are additive and site-scoped | P0 |
| FR-1.9 | First-run onboarding: pick home site, pick team, set default in-office days, enable notifications | P0 |

### 7.2 Finding and booking a desk

| # | Requirement | Pri |
|---|---|---|
| FR-2.1 | Home screen shows the next 7 days with per-day availability at the user's home site and their own bookings | P0 |
| FR-2.2 | Book a desk for a whole day, morning, afternoon, or a custom time range within opening hours | P0 |
| FR-2.3 | Interactive floor plan: pan, pinch-zoom, tap a desk to see details and book. Desks colored by state (free / booked / mine / unavailable / assigned) | P0 |
| FR-2.4 | List view as an equal alternative to the floor plan, sorted by relevance (near my team, my favorites, matching attributes) | P0 |
| FR-2.5 | Filter by attributes: sit/stand, monitor count, dock type, window, quiet zone, accessible, dual-screen | P0 |
| FR-2.6 | Multi-day booking in one flow (e.g. "Tue + Thu for the next 4 weeks") | P0 |
| FR-2.7 | Recurring bookings with an end date and an exceptions list; conflicts surfaced before confirmation | P1 |
| FR-2.8 | Favorite desks and zones; one-tap "book my usual" | P0 |
| FR-2.9 | Auto-assign: "just give me a seat" picks the best desk using team proximity + past preference | P1 |
| FR-2.10 | Book on behalf of another user (Team Lead and Admin only), with the delegate recorded | P1 |
| FR-2.11 | Waitlist when a day/zone is full; auto-offer on release with a time-boxed claim window | P2 |

| FR-3.4 | No external calendar integration. Rooms are bookable only in this product. Onboarding must make rooms unbookable in the customer's directory (remove or restrict the resource mailbox), because a room bookable in both systems will be double-booked and we cannot detect it (see TDD §7.2) | P0 |
| FR-3.5 | Find-a-room: "3 people, next 30 minutes, this floor" → instant-book the best fit | P1 |

| FR-5.2 | Search a colleague and see their upcoming office days (subject to their privacy setting) | P0 |
| FR-5.3 | Book a desk next to a specific colleague ("sit near Marcus") | P0 |
| FR-5.4 | Team view: a week grid of the team's planned presence, with the team's anchor days highlighted | P0 |

| FR-6.3 | Site capacity cap: hard limit on bookings per day, below physical desk count if desired | P0 |
| FR-6.4 | Zone permissions: a zone bookable only by named groups, or bookable by anyone after a cut-off time | P0 |
| FR-6.5 | Blackout dates and site closures (holidays, maintenance) block booking and cancel existing bookings with notice | P0 |
| FR-6.6 | Hybrid quota: minimum or maximum in-office days per week/month, with progress shown to the user | P1 |
| FR-6.7 | Assigned desks: a desk owned by a user, released to the pool automatically when the owner marks a day away | P1 |
| FR-6.8 | Cancellation cut-off and repeated-no-show consequences (warn, then restrict) | P1 |

## 8. Technical direction (constraints for the technical design)

The full technical design is a separate document. This section records the platform decisions the
product requirements depend on, and the constraints the design must respect.

**Stack decision (2026-09-18):** React + Capacitor on the client, FastAPI + Postgres on the server.
This supersedes the earlier Expo / React Native recommendation. The governing principle is to keep
the implementation as simple as it can be while still meeting the P0 requirements in §7.

### 8.1 Client: one React codebase, shipped natively via Capacitor

**Recommendation: a single React (TypeScript, Vite) application, packaged for iOS and Android with
Capacitor and served as-is on the web.**

Capacitor compiles the web bundle into the app binary and runs it in a native shell — WKWebView on
iOS, Android WebView — with a typed bridge to native APIs through plugins. The assets ship *inside*
the binary rather than being fetched from a URL, which is what makes offline (FR-10.1) work and what
keeps the app on the right side of App Store review.

Why it fits this product:

- **It collapses two frontends into one.** §7.8 requires a responsive web admin console, including a
  visual floor-plan editor (FR-8.2). Under a React Native plan that is a second application: a second
  component library, a second state layer, and the floor plan written twice — once in
  `react-native-svg` for the employee viewer, once in DOM SVG for the admin editor. Here the viewer
  and the editor are the same SVG component, with editing affordances gated by role. This is the
  single largest simplification available to this project.
- **The floor plan is a pan/zoom SVG scene**, which the DOM does natively. It must be built a
  specific way (§8.1.2, condition 1), but no native rendering engine is needed.
- **Accessibility (FR-10.5) gets materially easier.** WCAG 2.2 AA is defined in terms of the web
  platform. Screen-reader semantics, focus management, contrast and dynamic type are native concerns
  of the DOM rather than things to re-implement.
- **Offline (FR-10.1) is mostly free.** The app shell is already local; a service worker plus
  IndexedDB and a TanStack Query persister cover cached bookings and the queued-check-in path.
- One codebase for iOS, Android and web matters more than usual here, because the surface area is
  wide (booking, plans, scanning, admin overrides) and the team will be small.

#### 8.1.1 Native capability map

Every P0 native requirement has a supported Capacitor path. Exact packages and versions to be
confirmed during Phase 0 — this ecosystem moves.

| Requirement | Plugin / approach |
|---|---|
| FR-4.1 QR check-in | `@capacitor-mlkit/barcode-scanning` |
| FR-7.1 Push | `@capacitor/push-notifications` + APNs / FCM |
| FR-4.2 Geofence check-in | `@capacitor/geolocation`, foreground one-shot read |
| FR-1.4 Token storage | A Keychain/Keystore-backed secure-storage plugin — **not** `@capacitor/preferences`, which is plaintext |
| FR-1.1 OIDC/PKCE | `@capacitor/browser` (system browser) + Universal Links / App Links |
| FR-10.3 Deep links | `@capacitor/app` `appUrlOpen` |
| FR-1.5 Biometrics (P1) | A Capacitor biometric-auth plugin |
| FR-10.1 Offline | Service worker + IndexedDB + TanStack Query persistence |
| FR-7.3 Calendar convenience (P1) | Ship an `.ics` via `@capacitor/share`; no calendar plugin needed |
| FR-10.6 Home-screen widget (P2) | Requires native code; genuinely out of reach in this stack |

Two clarifications this stack forces, both of which simplify the product:

- **No background location.** §9.4 already restricts location to in-use and stores only the boolean
  "inside the fence". FR-4.2 is therefore a one-shot position read when the user opens check-in,
  evaluated against the site fence server-side. Background geofencing was never required by the
  privacy stance, and the capable plugins for it are commercially licensed.
- **No calendar-write plugin.** FR-7.3 is satisfied by an `.ics` attachment and a share sheet.

#### 8.1.2 Conditions

1. **Build the floor plan for the compositor, not for React.** §9.1 asks for 300 desks under 1.0s
   with sustained 60fps pan/zoom. That is achievable in a webview only if the SVG is rendered once,
   pan/zoom is a CSS transform on a single wrapper `<g>` so it stays GPU-composited, the gesture
   writes directly to the DOM through a ref, and React state updates only on gesture end. Desk state
   changes are CSS class swaps, not re-renders. Built naively — React state on every pointer move —
   it will not hold 60fps on mid-tier Android. Spike this in Phase 0 on real low-end hardware with
   300 nodes.
2. **Spike barcode scanning in Phase 0.** The MLKit plugin renders the native camera preview *behind*
   the webview, so the webview background must be made transparent and the scanning UI drawn in HTML
   over it. It is a documented pattern, but it is the one place the webview abstraction leaks.
   Budget a day, not an afternoon.
3. **Keep the bundle local.** Never point the webview at a remote URL to get faster updates. It
   breaks FR-10.1 and invites rejection under App Store guideline 4.2 (minimum functionality). This
   product's use of camera, push, biometrics, location, deep links and offline storage makes it
   clearly not a repackaged website — provided it stays packaged.
4. **Decide the OTA story explicitly (FR-10.7). Open — close before Phase 0 exits.** This is the one
   real capability regression versus Expo's EAS Update, which would have given same-day JS fixes
   during an enterprise rollout. The options are a third-party live-update service (Capgo,
   self-hostable or paid; Ionic Live Updates, paid) or accepting store review cycles and demoting
   FR-10.7 to P2.
5. **Budget for webview housekeeping.** Safe areas, keyboard behaviour and scroll containment on iOS
   need `@capacitor/keyboard` and disciplined CSS (`dvh`, `env(safe-area-inset-*)`). Individually
   trivial, collectively a recurring tax.
6. **macOS is required for iOS builds.** There is no managed build service equivalent to EAS Build
   here; plan on GitHub Actions with a macOS runner plus fastlane.

Where Capacitor would have been the wrong call — heavy 3D/AR, real-time video processing, sustained
native-thread computation — is not where this product lives.

Supporting choices: Vite, TypeScript throughout, TanStack Query for server state and offline cache,
IndexedDB for the offline store, react-i18next for FR-10.4, and route-based code splitting with the
admin tree lazy-loaded. **One application, not two** — lazy chunks cost disk, not cold-start time, so
a single app stays simple without violating §9.1. Split into separate builds only if bundle size
measurably hurts.

### 8.2 Backend: FastAPI + Postgres

Confirmed, with two deliberate reductions in scope from the earlier draft.

- **Booking is a reservation problem, and Postgres is unusually good at reservation problems.**
  `tstzrange` columns plus a `GIST` exclusion constraint make double-booking structurally impossible
  at the database level, rather than something the application has to get right under concurrency.
  This is non-negotiable in the technical design — FR-2.13 is enforced by the schema, not by
  application locks. It is also the single best simplicity decision available to this project: it
  deletes an entire class of concurrency code.
- Async FastAPI handles the notification fan-out and scheduled-sweep workload well; SQLAlchemy 2.0
  async + Alembic for migrations; Pydantic v2 for the contracts.
- The OpenAPI schema FastAPI generates drives a **generated TypeScript client**, so the API contract
  cannot silently drift from the client code. This is worth more under the single-codebase client
  decision, because one generated client now serves both the employee app and the admin console.
- **Background work starts in Postgres, not Redis.** Reminders, auto-release sweeps, analytics
  rollups and report generation are low-volume scheduled work. A jobs table drained by a single
  worker process using `SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` does this correctly, on infrastructure we
  already run. Introduce Redis and a task broker (Celery, ARQ) when measured volume argues for it,
  not before. *(Reduced from the earlier draft, which specified a broker from day one.)*
- **Multi-tenancy is enforced in one place in application code:** `organization_id` on every table,
  every query routed through a repository layer that requires it, backed by the automated
  cross-tenant tests §9.3 already mandates. Postgres row-level security is stronger and remains the
  right Phase 4 target for enterprise review, but RLS under async connection pooling requires
  `SET LOCAL` per transaction and is a persistent source of subtle bugs. Deferring it is a judgment
  call, recorded here so it is revisited deliberately rather than forgotten. *(Reduced from the
  earlier draft, which specified RLS from the start.)*

### 8.3 Other platform constraints

*(Unchanged by the stack decision — these are stack-independent.)*

- **Timezones:** store UTC, render in the *site's* timezone (FR-2.14). A booking's day boundary is
  defined by the site, not the device. This is a common source of correctness bugs; the design should
  call out a single canonical helper.
- **There is no calendar integration** (Q3, revised). Rooms are ordinary bookable resources in our
  own system. This removes what would have been the largest and highest-risk subsystem, and makes
  rooms cheap enough to build alongside desks rather than as a separate phase. The residual risk is
  organizational rather than technical: any room left bookable in Outlook or Google will eventually
  be double-booked, and we will not know. Directory lockdown is therefore an onboarding requirement
  (FR-3.4), and Outlook-habituated employees adopting a second tool for rooms is an adoption risk to
  validate with the design partner early.
- **Idempotency keys** on all booking-mutating endpoints, because mobile clients retry.
- **Observability from Phase 1:** structured logs, traces, and a booking-funnel event stream — we cannot
  measure G1/G3 retroactively.

---

## 9. Non-functional requirements

### 9.1 Performance

- Cold app start to interactive home screen: < 2.0s on a mid-tier Android device (p75).
- Floor plan first render with 300 desks: < 1.0s; pan/zoom sustained at 60fps.
- Booking write API p95 < 300ms; read endpoints p95 < 200ms.
- Support 5,000 concurrent users per org during the Monday 08:00 booking peak, which is the real
  load pattern: traffic is not uniform, it is a spike at the start of the workweek in each timezone.

### 9.2 Availability and reliability

- 99.9% monthly availability target for the API.
- Degraded mode: if push or email delivery is down, booking and check-in still work.
- RPO 5 minutes / RTO 1 hour; automated restore test quarterly.
- No booking is ever lost silently: every rejected write returns a reason the app can display (FR-6.9).

### 9.3 Security

- SSO-first; no password storage for SSO orgs.
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest; secrets in a managed secret store.
- Tenant isolation verified by automated tests that attempt cross-tenant reads on every endpoint.
- Signed, rotatable QR payloads — a photographed QR code must not be replayable indefinitely from home.
- Rate limiting per user and per org; abuse protection on the magic-link endpoint.
- Annual penetration test; SOC 2 Type II readiness as a Phase 4 goal (enterprise buyers will ask).
- Mobile: tokens in the Keychain/Keystore, certificate pinning optional per org, no PII in logs.

### 9.4 Privacy and compliance

Presence data is data about where a named employee physically is, which makes this product more
privacy-sensitive than its feature list suggests. Requirements:

- GDPR: lawful basis documented, DPA available, EU data residency option, data-subject export and
  erasure flows, sub-processor list.
- Location is used only for geofence check-in, only while the app is in use unless the user opts into
  background, and the raw coordinates are never stored — only the boolean "inside the fence".
- Colleague visibility is opt-out per user and killable org-wide (FR-5.6), because European works
  councils will require it.
- Manager-facing analytics are aggregated; the product does not provide per-person attendance
  reporting for performance-management purposes (FR-9.5). This is a deliberate product position.
- Configurable retention with a default of 13 months for identifiable booking rows (FR-9.7).

### 9.5 Accessibility, i18n, and quality bars

- WCAG 2.2 AA-equivalent behavior in the mobile app; the floor plan always has an equivalent list path.
- Four launch languages; all strings externalized from the first line of code.
- Crash-free sessions ≥ 99.5%.
- Supported OS: iOS 16+, Android 10+ (covers >95% of corporate devices at launch).

## 11. Phased delivery plan

Each phase ends in something shippable to a real user. Durations assume a small team
(2 client, 2 backend, 1 design, shared PM) and are estimates to be re-baselined after Phase 0.
Note that "2 client" now covers the employee app *and* the admin console, because §8.1 makes them
one codebase — this is why the earlier "2 mobile" figure no longer implies a separate web team.

### Phase 0 — Foundations (~3 weeks)
Repo and CI/CD for client and API; a React + Capacitor shell building and launching on both
platforms; FastAPI skeleton with Postgres and migrations; the tenant/site/floor/zone/resource/booking
schema including the exclusion constraint; OIDC sign-in end to end for one IdP; generated TS client;
observability wired.

Two spikes run in parallel and gate the stack (§8.1.2): the 300-desk floor-plan pan/zoom on real
low-end Android hardware, and MLKit barcode scanning behind a transparent webview. The OTA decision
(§8.1.2, condition 4) closes in this phase.
**Exit:** a developer can sign in on a real phone and read a seeded site from the real API, and both
spikes have passed — or the stack decision has been deliberately re-opened.

### Phase 1 — Desk booking MVP (~7 weeks)
FR-1.1–1.4, 1.8, 1.9 · FR-2.1–2.6, 2.8, 2.12–2.14 · FR-5.1, 5.5, 5.6 · FR-6.1–6.3, 6.9 ·
FR-7.1–7.4 · FR-8.1–8.4, 8.6 · FR-10.1–10.3, 10.5.
The floor-plan editor and the floor-plan viewer are the long poles — start them in week 1.
**Exit:** a design-partner office runs on it for two weeks with no spreadsheet fallback.

### Phase 2 — Check-in, rooms, and trust in the data (~4 weeks)
FR-4.1–4.5, 4.7 · FR-3.1–3.4 · FR-8.7 · FR-9.1–9.3 · FR-2.9 · FR-5.3.
Shortened from six weeks: with no calendar integration, rooms reuse the desk booking engine entirely
and the remaining cost is UI (timeline view, attendee list, three policy rules). Basic room booking
could reasonably move into Phase 1.
**Exit:** utilization numbers the workplace manager is willing to show Finance.

### Phase 3 — Coordination and policy depth (~6 weeks)
FR-5.2, 5.4, 5.7, 5.8 · FR-6.4–6.8 · FR-2.7, 2.10 · FR-3.5–3.7 · FR-4.6, 4.8 · FR-9.4–9.6 ·
FR-8.5, 8.8 · FR-10.4, 10.7.
**Exit:** teams coordinate anchor days in-app; admins self-serve policy without support tickets.

### Phase 4 — Enterprise readiness and expansion (~8 weeks)
FR-1.5–1.7 (SCIM, SAML, biometrics) · FR-7.5 (Slack/Teams) · FR-2.11 (waitlist) · FR-3.8 (room kiosk) ·
FR-10.6 (widgets) · SOC 2 Type II program · EU data residency · visitor management and parking as the
next resource types.
**Exit:** passes an enterprise IT security review without custom engineering.

### Sequencing notes
- Ship check-in (Phase 2) before analytics depth: utilization data without check-in is booking data,
  and booking data overstates occupancy by 20–40%. Selling the earlier number damages trust.
- Do not let room booking slip past Phase 2. Buyers evaluate desks and rooms together even though
  employees use them separately.
- The admin floor-plan editor is consistently underestimated. It is a small CAD-ish tool and deserves
  its own design review.

## 12. Risks

| # | Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Rooms stay bookable in Outlook/Google, so the same room is booked in two systems | Physical double-booking we cannot detect, and blame lands on us | Directory lockdown is a hard onboarding gate (FR-3.4), verified and signed off before go-live; admin console states the requirement; validate Outlook-habit adoption with the design partner in week one |
| R2 | Employees don't check in, so utilization data stays unreliable | Kills the core value prop for the buyer | Make check-in one tap and hard to miss; geofence as the default path; measure weekly |
| R3 | Works councils or privacy reviews block presence features in EU | Loses the coordination differentiator in a core market | Opt-out and org kill-switch built in from Phase 1; aggregate-only manager analytics as a product stance |
| R4 | ~~Intune MAM~~ *(resolved: out of scope, §5.3)*. Residual: a later customer mandates MDM-only distribution | Weeks of unplanned mobile work | Re-open as a scoped project if it appears; do not pre-build for it |
| R5 | Floor-plan authoring friction stalls onboarding | Long time-to-value, churn before habit forms | Invest in bulk desk placement and CSV import; offer a white-glove first-office setup |
| R6 | Monday-morning booking spike causes contention or double-book bugs | Visible failure at the worst moment | DB-level exclusion constraints; load-test the spike shape specifically, not average load |
| R7 | Commoditization — deskbird and incumbents are established | Pricing pressure | Compete on mobile quality and setup speed; stay out of full IWMS scope |
| R8 | The floor plan does not hold 60fps in a webview on mid-tier Android | The product's primary screen feels cheap; §9.1 missed on the one screen users judge us by | Build it compositor-first (§8.1.2, condition 1); prove it with a 300-node spike on real low-end hardware in Phase 0, before the rest of the app depends on it |
| R9 | No same-day JS fix path, unlike the EAS Update capability the earlier stack would have given | A Monday-morning bug blocks a customer until store review clears | Close the OTA decision in Phase 0 (§8.1.2, condition 4): fund a live-update service, or accept the review cycle and demote FR-10.7 |

## 13. Out of scope for v1 (recorded so it stays out)

**Microsoft 365 / Google Calendar integration in any direction** · lease/portfolio management ·
CAD/BIM import · maintenance ticketing · door access control · badge hardware · sensor-based
occupancy (IoT) · catering · cleaning workflows · parking · lockers · visitor management ·
desk-level environmental data · self-serve credit-card signup · on-premise deployment · a full
employee web app.

Several of these (parking, lockers, visitors, sensors) are natural extensions and the resource
and booking model must be general enough to absorb them without a rewrite.

---

## 14. Next steps

1. ~~Answer Q1–Q6~~ — answered in §5.3, with Q3 subsequently revised to "no calendar integration".
2. Confirm priorities in §7; anything marked P0 that isn't truly must-ship should be demoted now.
3. Produce the Technical Design Document: data model and constraints, API surface, auth flows,
   floor-plan rendering and authoring, offline/sync strategy, infrastructure and environments.
   *(Done 2026-09-19 — see [TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md](./TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md), written against the §8
   stack decision, not the superseded Expo one. Note its §17.3, which records four limitations that
   constrain requirements in §7 of this document.)*
4. Close the one open stack decision — OTA / live updates (§8.1.2, condition 4) — and run the two
   Phase 0 spikes before the rest of the client work depends on them.
5. Build the Phase 0 skeleton and re-baseline the estimates against real velocity.
